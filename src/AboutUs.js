      <h1>About Us - Muay Thai Beats</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Muay Thai Beats!</p>
      <p>
        We are a unique club that combines the art of Muay Thai with the energy and rhythm of music. Our innovative approach leverages the power of beats and tempos to enhance the training experience, making it both effective and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Our vision is to make Muay Thai more accessible and engaging by integrating music into the training process. We believe that music can provide a structured and fun way to learn and practice Muay Thai.
      </p>
      <h2>The Concept</h2>
      <h3>Using Music to Guide Muay Thai Training</h3>
      <p>
        Imagine training Muay Thai to the rhythm of a house song, where the beats dictate your movements and combinations. We use a DJ controller to mix a house song with a variable BPM &#40;beats per minute&#41; and a track of vocal instructions that guide you through different combos.
      </p>
      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dual Channel Mixing: We mix a house beat &#40;channel one&#41; with vocal instructions &#40;channel two&#41;.</li>
        <li>Call and Response: The vocals provide the call &#40;e.g., jab-jab-cross&#41;, and the music responds with an associated combo in the next musical phrase.</li>
        <li>Incremental BPM: We start with a slower BPM to help members familiarize themselves with the strikes and combos. As members get more comfortable, we increase the BPM to match their skill level, promoting muscle memory and correct technique.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Combos Translated to Music:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Call: The actual name of the strikes &#40;e.g., jab, cross, hook&#41; said on beat.</li>
        <li>Response: The numbered version of the strike overlayed with music elements &#40;e.g., chord progression, drums, 808s&#41;.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Musical Elements:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hi-hats: Represent jabs.</li>
        <li>Snare: Represents crosses or hooks.</li>
        <li>Kicks: Represent quick strikes.</li>
      </ul>
